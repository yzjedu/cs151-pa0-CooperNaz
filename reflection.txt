Programming for myself wasn't too different than doing it with a partner, at least this time. I was able to learn the
process of creating an algorithm and code somewhat from scratch without having many prerequisites from the professor.
Next time I would probably try doing the algorithm and the code in a closer time frame than I did this time.
I ended up writing the code before writing the algorithm, but that code developed and changed as we learned in class,
incorporating things such as rounding to two decimal points and proper input prompts. Over the span of the assignment,
the program changed and became better, and to my knowledge the results are somewhat accurate, even though the results
are meant to be an approximation, not accounting for the slope of the sides of the cup or the thickness of the bottom
or sides of the cup. I believe I did the best I could with the problem I was given and my current knowledge, and I'm
proud of the clear improvement I've made since the start of the assignment.
